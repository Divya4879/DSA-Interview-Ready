## ‚úÖ **Recommendation for Render Deployment**

**Use Option 1 (Minimal Deployment)** with these 5 essential files:

1. `setup_problems.py` - Main setup script (called by Render)
2. `create_production_problems.py` - Core problem dataset
3. `create_tagged_problems.py` - Enhanced search functionality
4. `setup_redis.py` - Database configuration
5. `init_redis_data.py` - Initial data setup

This provides everything needed for a successful production deployment while keeping the repository clean and focused.

**Individual commit commands:**
```bash
git add scripts/setup_problems.py
git commit -m "feat(scripts): Add main problem setup script for production deployment"

git add scripts/create_production_problems.py  
git commit -m "data(scripts): Add production-ready problem dataset with comprehensive coverage"

git add scripts/create_tagged_problems.py
git commit -m "feat(scripts): Add tagged problem creation for enhanced search functionality"

git add scripts/setup_redis.py
git commit -m "config(scripts): Add Redis database initialization and configuration"

git add scripts/init_redis_data.py
git commit -m "data(scripts): Add Redis data initialization with user profiles and analytics"
```
